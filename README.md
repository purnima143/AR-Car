## Objective

AR Car Showroom is an augmented reality app for  Android platforms that recreates the lifelike experience of examining a real-sized luxury vehicle in any location, providing users a unique chance to check out the desired car without visiting a salon.
Developed as a showcase solution it allows car brands to demonstrate autos to their clients all over the world. 


  
## Features

AR-CASCA Car Showroom would provide a highly realistic visualization of the luxury vehicle, bringing the automotive showroom on a platter to the customer. 

- The virtual experience would resemble the real-life situation — users would be able to rotate, move, enter inside and even divide it into parts.

- Projecting a full size vehicle in the real world.  Then using voice commands, open the car doors, change the colors etc. Even view a car promotional video on an augmented reality video screen placed on the dashboard of the car.

-  By entering inside, potential car owners would see if the car they planned to buy would be convenient to drive. Clients would use  Android device and hold it in front of an area they want to see a vehicle in.

  ## How it works
  

- Customers can hold a phone camera in front of them and visualize a car. With just a few swipes, it is possible to rotate, change the color, scale, zoom, and choose the wheels.
The virtual experience would resemble the real-life situation — users would be able to rotate, move, enter inside and even divide it into parts.
- The user can give command for closing opening of door,windows and also for starting engine.
- The user is able to see in how the car looks inside (steering wheel, rev counter, sat nav, gear level, and other components). 
- Viewers would be able to enjoy a 3D walk around the car and observe its features which are possible only with real objects.
